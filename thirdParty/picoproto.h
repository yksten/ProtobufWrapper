/*
 See the README for full details, but this module lets you read in protobuf
 encoded files with a minimal code footprint.
 
 It doesn't create classes for each kind of message it encounters, it just has a
 single Message interface that lets you access the members of the protobuf as a
 key/value store. This loses a lot of the convenience of type-checked classes,
 but it does mean that very little code is needed to access data from files.
 
 As a simple example, if you had read a `bytes_size` long file into `bytes` that
 contained a TensorFlow GraphDef proto:
 
 Message graph_def;
 graph_def.ParseFromBytes(bytes, bytes_size);
 
 You can then access the different fields of the GraphDef using the field
 numbers assigned in the .proto file:
 
 std::vector<picoproto::Message*> nodes = graph_def.GetMessageArray(1);
 
 One big difference between this minimal approach and normal protobufs is that
 the calling code has to already know the field number and type of any members
 it's trying to access. Here I know that the `node` field is number 1, and that
 it should contain a repeated list of NodeDefs. Since they are not primitive
 types like numbers or strings, they are accessed as an array of Messages.
 
 Here are the design goals of this module:
  - Keep the code size tiny (single-digit kilobytes on most platforms).
  - Minimize memory usage (for example allow in-place references to byte data).
  - Provide a simple, readable implementation that can be ported easily.
  - Deserialize all saved protobuf files into a usable representation.
  - No dependencies other than the standard C++ library.
  - No build-time support (e.g. protoc) required.
 
 Here's what it's explicitly not offering:
  - Providing a readable and transparent way of accessing serialized data.
  - Saving out data to protobuf format.
